This folder is a collection of all of the labs I did and still have access to from my microcontrollers class. Each incremental lab is more comprehensive than the previous.
We learned a lot in this class by doing, there were small(or large) pieces of codefilled in by our professor and we were always required to figure out the rest.
Typically, we were provided a file with predefined functions or instantiations by our professor, and were required to incrementally build on those.
Most labs were completed in C, but some in ASM.
